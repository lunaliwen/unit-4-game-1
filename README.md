# Design Notes

* Player is shown a random numebr at the start of the game, from 19 - 120.
* Four crystals at bottom of the page each have a hidden value, from 1-12.
* As Player clicks on each crystak=l, the hidden value is revealed and added to their runniing score.
* If the Player matches their total score to the target number, it is counted as a winning round. The win counter will go up by 1, the players running score will reset to 0, a new random number will appear as the target and each of he crystals will recieve another random value.
* If the Player's total score exceeds the target number, it is counted as a losing round. The loss counter will go up by 1, the players running score will reset to 0, a new random number will appear as the target and each of he crystals will recieve another random value.
